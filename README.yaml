  Terraform module to provision a Public [`AWS ECR Docker Container registry`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-repositories.html/).

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  The module creates one or more Elastic Container Registry (ECR) Public repositories. Please note that this 
  module can only be provisioned in the US-EAST-1 region.

  Write access to the repositories is granted to via the `principals_full_access` list, which is a list of strings that 
  can designate [any valid AWS Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#Principal_specifying).
  This module only creates the Repository Policy allowing those Principals access. The Principals will still separately 
  need IAM policies allowing them permission to execute ECR actions against the repository. For more details, see
  [How Amazon Elastic Container Registry Works with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html).

  Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

  ```hcl
  # IAM Role to be granted ECR permissions
  data "aws_iam_role" "ecrpublic" {
    name = "ecr"
  }

  module "ecrpublic" {
    source = "cloudposse/ecr-public/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
    namespace              = "eg"
    stage                  = "test"
    name                   = "ecr"
    principals_full_access = [data.aws_iam_role.ecr.arn]
    repository_configs     = [
      {
        name              = "foo"
        description       = "The repository for the foo image"
        about_text        = null
        usage_text        = null
        architectures     = ["AMD64"]
        operating_systems = ["Linux"]
      },
    ]
  }
  ```
